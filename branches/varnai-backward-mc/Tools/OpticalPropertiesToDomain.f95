program opticalPropertiesToDomain
 ! $Revision$, $Date$
 ! $URL$
 
 ! This program converts optical properties from an SHDOM-like ascii file
 ! to an I3RC Monte Carlo optical property domain object, and writes this
 ! object to a file.  The ascii input file of optical properties is almost
 ! the same as an SHDOM tabulated phase function file, but with nz+1 height
 ! levels, where nz is the number of grid cells in the vertical.  This
 ! difference is due to SHDOM representing optical properties at grid points,
 ! while the I3RC Monte Carlo code represents properties in uniform grid cells.
 ! 
 ! The input file format has a 4+NUMPHASE header lines, where NUMPHASE is the
 ! number of phase functions: the first line must begin with 'T'; the second
 ! has the number of grid cells in each dimension; the third has the grid
 ! spacing and Z levels; the fourth has the number of phase functions; and the
 ! following "lines" have the phase functions containing the degree of the
 ! Legendre expansion and then the Legendre coefficients.   There is then one
 ! line for every grid cell containing the grid cell X,Y,Z indices, the
 ! temperature, the extinction, single scattering albedo, and phase function
 ! index (1 to NUMPHASE) to the table in the header.  The format is as follows:
 !     T
 !     Nx  Ny  Nz
 !     delX  delY  Z(1) ... Z(Nz+1)
 !     numphase
 !     NumL  Chi1 ...  ChiL       (for each phase function)
 !       . . .
 !     IX IY IZ  Temp Extinct Albedo  Iphase
 !       . . .
 ! where IX, IY, and IZ are the grid cell spatial indices (1,...,Nx, etc.),
 ! Temp is the grid cell temperature in Kelvin, Extinct is the extinction
 ! in units inverse of the grid spacing units, Albedo is the single
 ! scattering albedo, and Iphase is the phase function table index.
 ! NumL is the Legendre series degree, and Chi(l) are the coefficients of the
 ! Legendre expansion of the phase function.  The Legendre coefficients are
 ! normalized so that Chi0 (which is not listed) is always 1. The Legendre
 ! coefficients are defined so that Chi1 is 3*g, where g is the asymmetry
 ! parameter [e.g. a Henyey-Greenstein phase function is Chi(l)=(2*l+1)g^l].
 ! NOTE that this is not the convention used by the I3RC code; this program 
 ! converts the moments that are read in by 2*l + 1.
 ! The Legendre coefficients do not actually need to be all on one line, but
 ! can continue across multiple lines.  The first Z level is the bottom of the
 ! lowest grid cell and the last is the top of the highest grid cell.
